TODO AT COMPETITION
	Tune target color bounds for the field lighting
	
	PID tune pan and tilt for new robot (now have different up and down constants)

	Set new feeder motor speed

	Find optimal shooter wheel speed and power (for autonomous)

	See if our "aim high" correction still applies to new robot





Tune vertical angle adjustment for distance shooting (it works well at the end of the tower)
